# NFT Marketplace (By Gil)

- This is my third full-stack blockchain project, which both back-end and front-end were thought, written and tested by me.
- It was based on the Patrick Collins Course - Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript.

- Blockchain/Web3 Developer.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
